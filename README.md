# noob-dom-projects
Trying out some beginner DOM projects  
All of them use Tailwind CSS and vanilla JS, and are responsive.

Installing Tailwind:  
`npm i tailwindcss`

To build the Tailwind stylesheet:  
`tailwind build -i ./src/style.css -o .dist/style.css`

To remove unused tailwind utilities, enable purge in `tailwind.config.js`
